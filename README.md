hi there

my name is Simon: a Waterloo CompSci student in 2A

when I'm not busy hacking the world (which is probably 90% of the time), I'm probably watching a movie or listening to my favourite beats

courses that I'm enjoying this semester:

-> MUSIC100

-> JAPAN101

courses I wish I could stay away from with a 10-feet pole:

-> CS246

-> CS245
